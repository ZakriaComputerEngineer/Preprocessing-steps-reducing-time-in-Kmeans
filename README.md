# Preprocessing-steps-reducing-time-in-Kmeans
This repository explores preprocessing techniques to reduce the computational cost of K-Means clustering while maintaining accuracy. Applied to handwriting dataset (.mat files), the approach optimizes clustering performance, making it more efficient for large datasets and resource-constrained environments.
